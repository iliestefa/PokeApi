This Model Context Data defines how Cursor should assist in a React project.

The assistant must follow these guidelines when generating, editing or reviewing code:

1. React Component Structure
   - Components must be small, readable and follow a single responsibility.
   - Prefer splitting large components into smaller ones.
   - Avoid mixing UI with complex logic. Move logic into custom hooks.
   - Components should not exceed ~300 lines.

2. Naming Conventions
   - Components must use PascalCase.
   - Variables and functions must use camelCase.
   - All names must be descriptive and avoid vague terms like "data", "info", "handler2", etc.

3. Proper Use of Hooks
   - Avoid complex logic inside useEffect.
   - Always include the correct dependencies in useEffect.
   - Avoid storing large objects in useState; prefer useReducer for complex state.
   - Repeated logic across components should be moved into custom hooks.

4. JSX Cleanliness
   - Do not include complex expressions inside JSX.
   - Precompute filters, maps, or conditionals before the return statement.
   - JSX blocks should remain small and readable, ideally under 50 lines.
   - List items must always use stable keys, never array index.

5. API and Data Fetching
   - Do not use fetch directly inside components.
   - All API calls must be centralized in service files or custom hooks.

6. Import Organization
   - Keep imports ordered as follows:
     1. external libraries
     2. hooks
     3. components
     4. utils
     5. styles
   - Remove unused imports automatically.

7. Dead Code Removal
   - Automatically remove commented-out code that is no longer needed.
   - Remove unused variables or functions.

8. Performance Best Practices
   - Only use React.memo, useCallback, or useMemo when they provide real benefits.
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders by keeping props stable.

9. Prop Validation / Typing
   - Every component must include either prop-types or TypeScript types.
   - Missing prop validation should be suggested automatically.

10. Component Function Syntax
    - Components must use arrow function syntax: `const ComponentName = () => {}`
    - Do NOT use function declarations: `function ComponentName() {}`
    - Export components as default exports: `export default ComponentName`

11. Styling Organization
    - Each component must have its own SCSS file in the same directory as the component.
    - Component SCSS files should be named: `ComponentName.scss`
    - Import styles in the component file: `import './ComponentName.scss'` or `import styles from './ComponentName.module.scss'`
    - Do NOT use a single global CSS file for all components. Each component should manage its own styles.
    - Global styles should only be in `index.css` or `App.css` for base/reset styles and app-wide utilities.

12. Constants Organization
    - All constants must be defined in separate files, typically in a `constants` directory.
    - Constants must use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention.
    - All constants from a domain can be exported together in a single file using named exports.
    - Example structure:
      ```
      constants/
        apiConstants.js
        themeConstants.js
      ```

The assistant must warn or suggest improvements when any of these guidelines are violated.
